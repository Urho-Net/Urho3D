    OpenGL ES Extension #XXX

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    Requires EGL 1.2 and either the EGL_KHR_image or EGL_KHR_image_base
    extensions as well as OES_EGL_image.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification and
    the OES_EGL_image extension.

Overview

    This extension adds functionality to that provided by OES_EGL_image in
    order to support cube map EGLImage. It extends the existing
    EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES entry point from OES_EGL_image. Render buffers
    are not extended to include cube map support.

    EGLImage cube map can be created using extended versions of eglCreateImageKHR.
    For example, EGL_MGL_mtl_texture_client_buffer can import cube map image native metal textures
    on devices where such native textures can be created.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification

    In section 3.8.2 within the specification added by OES_EGL_Image:

        "Currently, <target> must be TEXTURE_2D or TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP."

Errors

    GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated by EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES if
     <target> is not TEXTURE_2D or TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP

    GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by EGLImageTargetTexture2DOES if:
    - <target> is TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP and <image> is not cube map image.
    - <target> is TEXTURE_2D and <image> is not 2d image.

Issues

    None.
